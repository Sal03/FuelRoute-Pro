# Fuel Transportation Cost Estimation Tool

An interactive web tool to estimate transportation costs for alternative fuels such as hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia. The tool allows users to input fuel type, volume, transport mode, and origin-destination to calculate estimated logistics costs based on real-world data and models.

---

## Project Objectives

- Analyze cost components across various transportation modes (truck, rail, ship).
- Understand infrastructure constraints for alternative fuels.
- Build a web tool with UI input forms and backend logic.
- Validate model with case studies and refine with feedback.

---

## Key Features

- Input form for fuel type, volume, transport mode, origin & destination.
- Cost estimation based on mode-specific logic and assumptions.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Modular backend for future expansion (e.g., carbon impact, route mapping).
